# Motivated Memory

A place to store code that was used for data analysis from my MA psychology at UBC. All identifying data sets have been placed in the .gitignore. The code that was used to create the experiments will be in another repo. 

## Bubble View 

We used a tool called [BubbleView](https://bubbleview.namwkim.org) which is an alternative methidodology for eye tracking using discrete mouse clicks. This allowed up to measure which information people onsciously chose to examine. In our experiments, the experimental group were told that the underlying graph was about climate change while the control group was told it was a graph about some change in value.
